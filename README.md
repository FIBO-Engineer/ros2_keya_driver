# Automate CAN Interface Setup using systemd

This guide explains how to automatically set up the CAN interface (`can0`) using a `systemd` service file. Follow these steps to enable the CAN interface with a specified bitrate when the device is connected.

## Step 1: Create a systemd Service File

1. Create a new file named `/etc/systemd/system/setup-can0.service`:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/setup-can0.service
    ```

2. Add the following content to the service file:

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Setup CAN0 interface
    Wants=network-pre.target
    Before=network-pre.target
    BindsTo=sys-subsystem-net-devices-can0.device
    After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-can0.device

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=/sbin/ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
    ExecStop=/sbin/ip link set can0 down
    RemainAfterExit=yes

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    - The `[Unit]` section specifies dependencies and the order of activation.
    - The `[Service]` section defines the commands to set up and tear down the CAN interface.
    - The `[Install]` section determines when the service should be activated.

## Step 2: Reload `systemd` and Enable the Service

Run the following commands to reload `systemd` and enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable setup-can0.service
```

## Step 3: Start the Service (Optional)

To start the service immediately without rebooting:

```bash
sudo systemctl start setup-can0.service
```

## Verification

After enabling the service, disconnect and reconnect your CAN hardware. The `can0` interface should be configured automatically with the specified bitrate.

## Troubleshooting

If the service doesnâ€™t start as expected, check the status and logs using:

```bash
sudo systemctl status setup-can0.service
sudo journalctl -xe
```

## Summary

This `systemd` service method is suitable for automatically configuring CAN devices on boot or when the hardware is connected, making it ideal for persistent and reliable configurations.
